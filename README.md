Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization Project: 
This repository contains the implementation of five advanced demand forecasting models (ARIMA, XGBoost, Exponential Smoothing, Prophet, and Moving Average) developed during my project internship at ARO Scientific Ltd. The goal of this project was to optimize inventory management by accurately forecasting demand, achieving predictive accuracies ranging from 70% to 98% across different product categories.

Key Features:
Data Integration: Leveraged API integrations with Odoo ERP to extract and preprocess sales data, ensuring efficient data retrieval and maintaining the integrity of historical records.
Business Intelligence Dashboard: Designed and deployed a real-time Dash application for visualizing sales forecasts and inventory levels, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.
Model Evaluation: Utilized statistical metrics (RMSE, MSE) to assess and refine model performance based on product demand and sales patterns.
Actionable Insights: Provided recommendations to reduce stockout risks and optimize production planning, significantly benefiting inventory management.
This project highlights the practical application of machine learning and data analytics to solve real-world business challenges in supply chain and inventory management.

Technologies Used:
Python (ARIMA, XGBoost, Prophet, Exponential Smoothing, Moving Average)
Odoo ERP API
Dash for real-time visualization
Pandas, NumPy for data preprocessing
RMSE, MSE for performance evaluation
Feel free to explore the code and contribute!
